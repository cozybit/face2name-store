face2name Store - May 2010 - Carbon Five

The f2n Store is where face2name customers buy licenses so
that the f2n Server will work for particular events.


To install the face2name Store on your machine:
===============================================

Give yourself access on GitHub
    - If you don't have one already, make an SSH key on your computer.
      See http://help.github.com/mac-key-setup/
    - Add your SSH public key to GitHub account: www.github.com
    
Download the source
    git clone git@github.com:carbonfive/face2name-store.git
    (creates a face2name-store folder in the current folder)


Install RVM (optional but it's what I use below)
    bash < <( curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-latest )
    And then follow directions about appending something to your .bashrc

Install Ruby
    rvm gemset create f2n   (needed for our continuous integration server)
    rvm install ruby-1.8.7-p249
    rvm use ruby-1.8.7-p249@f2n
    Check with "rvm list" or "rvm info" to see that we are using ___-p249@f2n
    
Install Rails 3
    rvm gem install bundler
    bundle install  (note the missing R)
    
Run Tests
    cd face2name-store
    rake db:test:prepare
    rake test
    (if you have a copy of f2n server running, an integration test will also be run.)

Run Rails
    cd face2name-store
    rake db:migrate
    rails server
    (open browser to http://localhost:3000 )


Publish app to Heroku
=====================

Install Heroku
    gem install heroku

Add Heroku as a remote GIT repository
    Add the following lines to face2name-store/.git/config
        [remote "warm-beach-63"]
        	url = git@heroku.com:warm-beach-63.git
        	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/warm-beach-63/*

Push the source on your machine to Heroku
    git push warm-beach-63
    heroku rake db:migrate  (Depending on your changes, various DB tasks may need to be done.)
