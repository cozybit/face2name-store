face2name Store - May 2010 - Carbon Five

The f2n Store is where face2name customers buy licenses so
that the f2n Server will work for particular events.

The latest version of this file is stored in Git at:
    git@github.com:carbonfive/face2name-store.git > README
    

To install the face2name Store on your machine:
===============================================

Give yourself access on GitHub
    - Create a github account at www.github.com
    - As part of your github account, make an SSH key on your computer.
      See http://help.github.com/mac-key-setup/
    - Email carbonfive with your account name and ask to be added as a collaborator
      to the face2name repository.
    
Download the source
    git clone git@github.com:carbonfive/face2name-store.git
    (creates a face2name-store folder in the current folder)


Install RVM (optional but it's what I use below)
    bash < <( curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-latest )
    - And then follow directions about appending something to your .bash_profile.
    - You should now be able to type "rvm list" and rvm will give you some help.
    - When you "cd face2name-store", rvm will say "info: Using ruby 1.8.7 p249 with gemset f2n"

Install Ruby
    rvm install ruby-1.8.7-p249
    rvm use ruby-1.8.7-p249
    rvm gemset create f2n   (needed for our continuous integration server)
    rvm use ruby-1.8.7-p249@f2n
    - Check that "rvm list" shows an arrow at: => ruby-1.8.7-p249
    - Check that "rvm info" shows gemset: "f2n"
    
Install Rails 3 and all dependencies.
    cd face2name-store
    gem install bundler
    bundle install  (note the missing R) (This downloads and installs everything.
    
Run Tests
    cd face2name-store
    rake db:migrate
    rake db:test:prepare
    rake test
    - This runs three sets of tests. So check that all three report something like:
        ## tests, ## assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors
 

Run Rails
    cd face2name-store
    rails server
    - open browser to http://localhost:3000
    - login with admin@test.com / simple


Publish f2n Store to Heroku
===========================

Get access to Heroku
    - Javier logs in to www.heroku.com as javier@cozybit.com 
      (hopefully he remembers the password)
    - Javier goes to f2n-store-staging > General Info > Collaborators and 
      adds your email to invite you.

Install Heroku tool
    cd face2name-store
    gem install heroku

Add Heroku as a remote GIT repository
    heroku keys:add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (you should already have an id_rsa.pub)
    git remote add staging git@heroku.com:f2n-store-staging.git
    - or - 
    git remote add production git@heroku.com:f2n-store-production.git

Push the source on your machine to Heroku
    git push staging (takes nickname from the "gem remote add" command above.)
    heroku rake db:migrate  (Depending on your changes, various DB tasks may need to be done.)
